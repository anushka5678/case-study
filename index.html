        <h1>Case Study on Google Lens and MobileNet Model </h1>
        <h4>I have tested 3 everyday items to see whether Google Lens or MobileNet Model can identify them better. </h4>
        <div id="1st item"> 
        <span><h3 id="bottle">1. Perfume Bottle</h3></span> 
        <img src="61CBPmzLIfL._SX679_.jpg" class = "img-responsive" height="200px" width="300px">
        <p>MobileNet Model- MobileNet Model recognised it as "Hair Spray".</p>
        <p>Google Lens- Google Lens detected it as "Japanese Cherry Blossom Fragrance Mist Bath and Body Works"</p>
        <h4>In this case, Google Lens was more accurate.</h4>
        </div>
        <div id="2nd item"> 
            <span><h3 id="brush">2. Paint Brush</h3></span> 
            <img src="5-inch-wall-paint-brush-500x500.jpg" class = "img-responsive" height="200px" width="300px">
            <p>MobileNet Model- MobileNet Model recognised it as "Paint Brush".</p>
            <p>Google Lens- Google Lens detected it as "Brush" </p>
            <h4>In this case,MobileNet Model was more accurate.</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="3rd item"> 
                <span><h3 id="phone">3. Mobile Phone </h3></span> 
                <img src="o4OjCNmNeOhvsS1P.large" class = "img-responsive" height="200px" width="300px">
                <p>MobileNet Model- MobileNet Model recognised it as "Cell phone".</p>
                <p>Google Lens- Google Lens detected it as "Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime phone" </p>
                <h4>In this case,Google Lens was more accurate.</h4>
                </div>
                <h3 id="final">I have tested 3 items. Google Lens got 2/3 accurate. MobileNet Model got 1/3 accurate. I believe, according to this case study,
                    Google Lens was more accurate than MobileNet Model as it succeeded in perfectly guessing most of the items.
